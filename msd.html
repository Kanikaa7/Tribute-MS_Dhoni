                <p>MS Dhoni, born on July 7, 1981, is a former Indian cricketer and one of the most successful captains in the history of Indian cricket. Known for his calm demeanor and exceptional leadership skills, Dhoni led the Indian cricket team to numerous victories, including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, and the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.</p>
                <p>During his career, Dhoni established himself as one of the best wicket-keeper batsmen in the world. His lightning-fast stumping and powerful batting made him a formidable player in all formats of the game. Dhoni retired from international cricket in August 2020, leaving behind a remarkable legacy.</p>
